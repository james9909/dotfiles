Dotfiles
===========

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

Installation
--------------
If you only want to use some of my dotfiles, run `link.sh` to link files that you want.
Otherwise, if you want to install everything, run `install.sh`.

Vim
---

To build the latest version of vim, run the `updatevim` script in the `scripts` folder.

To install all the plugins, just run `:PlugInstall` when opening vim for the first time.

#### Terminal

These dotfiles are meant to be used with either [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/) or [urxvt](https://linux.die.net/man/1/urxvt)
The font used is `SauceCodePro Nerd Font Mono`.
