Dotfiles
===========

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.
Installation
--------------
For easy installation, modify `link.sh` to link files that you want, and run the script.

If you want to link the `vim` folder, make sure to add `--recursive` when cloning the repo.
Otherwise, submodules won't be cloned and you'll have to manually clone [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
