Dotfiles
===========

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.
Installation
--------------
For easy installation, modify `link.sh` to link files that you want, and run the script.

Regarding `vim`, since plugins are submoduled, [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) will not be cloned.

To install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), run:

`$ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

Then you can open up `vim` and run `:PluginInstall` to install the rest of the plugins.
